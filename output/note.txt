This is where the output files are stored. This parent directory consists of the following subdirectories:
    1. 'geodata': This directory contains all the output geodata files, including placements and exclusions_data
    2. 'logs': This directory contains all the log files generated during the run
    3. 'plots': Contains, obviously, all the plots generated during the run
    4. 'simulations': Contains all the output files from the simulations

There is also the final report.json file in this directory: output/report.json
